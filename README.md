Hey hey,

My name is **Antonis** and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer from Greece! I enjoy writting code for the web and mobile apps, mostly using React and React-Native.

I am currently working at [Kaizen Gaming](https://kaizengaming.com/home), leveling up the gaming experience for millions around the world.

When not working I enjoy going to the gym and playing video games.
