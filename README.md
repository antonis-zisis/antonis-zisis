Hey hey,

My name is **Antonis** and I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer from Greece! I enjoy writting code for the web and mobile apps, mostly using React and React-Native. I am currently working at [Causaly](https://www.causaly.com/), developing our solution to empower biomedical research. When not working I enjoy going to the gym and playing video games.
