Hey there! 👋 I’m Antonis, a software engineer based in Kalamata, Greece. I hold a B.Sc. in Software Engineering from the University of Salford and bring over a decade of professional experience across both startups and large-scale organizations.

I specialize in building robust backend systems, responsive web applications, and modern desktop and mobile experiences. I’m passionate about clean architecture, thoughtful system design, and crafting intuitive user interfaces that balance aesthetics with usability. Staying current with evolving technologies is a core part of my workflow, enabling me to deliver scalable, high-quality solutions.

Currently, I serve as a Software Engineering Team Lead at [Kaizen Gaming](https://kaizengaming.com/home), where I lead a team of seven engineers developing live event platforms for Stoiximan and Betano. My responsibilities include technical leadership, architectural decision-making, and mentoring engineers to help them grow and perform at their best.

Recently, I’ve been exploring Claude Code to streamline workflows and automate repetitive engineering tasks, allowing greater focus on high-value problem solving and system design.

Outside of engineering, you’ll find me at the gym, gaming, or watching movies.
